Colorizing brain CT images to Segment tumors:

Segmenting tumors from grayscale medical image data can be difficult due to the close intensity values between tumors and healthy tissues.
This research presents a study that demonstrates how colorizing CT images before segmentation can address this problem.
Colorizing the data a priori accentuates the tissue density differences between tumor and healthy tissue, thereby allowing for easier identification of the tumor tissue(s).
The method presented allows pixels representing tumor and healthy tissues to be colorized distinctly accurately and efficiently. 
The associated segmentation process is then tailored to utilize this color data.
